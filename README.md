# Cloud Computing
My journey into the cloud computing world started with Heroku, a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that enables simple application development and deployment. My interest in cloud computing was expanded when I started at Deloitte, and I have since then become a Google Associate Cloud Engineer and have deployed numerous services.

This repo will host different projects that I have worked on and expand along with my cloud world journey. Besides GitHub, I also use post blogs on https://medium.com/@ta.ghanoum where I share detailed info regarding Data Science projects.
